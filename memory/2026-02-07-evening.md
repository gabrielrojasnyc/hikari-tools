# 2026-02-07 - Trading Agent Architecture & Content Creation

## Trading Cron Jobs Setup
Designed and deployed a 4x/day automated trading loop with specialized agents:

| Time (ET) | Job Name | Agent | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| 6:00 AM Mon-Fri | `trading:morning-brief` | Mika | Pre-market research, futures, news, signals |
| 9:25 AM Mon-Fri | `trading:pre-open-check` | Sora | Pre-open orders, final signal review |
| 12:00 PM Mon-Fri | `trading:midday-check` | Sora | Midday position check, stops |
| 3:55 PM Mon-Fri | `trading:eod-report` | Sora | Close day trades, EOD P&L |

Key decisions made:
- **Not hourly** — too much noise, API costs add up, $500 budget needs discipline
- **4x/day strategic timing** — covers key market moments without overload
- **20 runs/week** vs 32+ for hourly = 37% fewer API calls
- All jobs run isolated agentTurn with medium thinking, deliver to Telegram

## Content Creation: 5 LinkedIn Posts
Drafted a 5-post series on building AI trading agents:

1. **The Why** — trading as proving ground for AI agents
2. **The Architecture** — Mika/Sora/Hikari multi-agent design
3. **The Stack** — OpenClaw, MCP, Alpaca/Schwab, Grok-4
4. **The Goals** — Phase 1→2→3, outcome-based automation
5. **The Philosophy** — 4 lessons: trust, specialization, feedback, infrastructure

Each post has LinkedIn (long-form) and Twitter (condensed) versions.

## Key Insights
- Gabe wants to publish these for "thought leadership" (his words: "tough leadership" — likely typo for "thought")
- **First principles framing** — Must be positioned as following Elon/Jensen Huang leadership style, NOT tied to ADP specifically
- Multi-agent approach validated: specialized > general, clear chain of command
- Trading is perfect testbed: fast feedback, real stakes, measurable outcomes
- Same architecture applies to any domain requiring complex workflows (ADP onboarding being one example among many)

## Next Steps (Pending Gabe)
- [ ] Review and revise the 5 LinkedIn posts
- [ ] Schedule publication (1x/day or spread across 2 weeks)
- [ ] Add visuals (architecture diagram, agent flow screenshots)
- [ ] First trading agent runs Monday 6:00 AM ET

## Global Standards Established
- **Telegram Formatting Best Practices** documented in MEMORY.md
  - No markdown tables (don't render properly)
  - Use bullet lists with emojis instead
  - Code blocks for aligned data (schedules, P&L)
  - Visual cards for task/status displays
  - Mobile-first: < 40 chars per line, whitespace between sections
- **Applies to all agents:** Hikari, Mika, Sora, Koji, future agents
- **Reference:** `docs/telegram-formatting-guide.md`
