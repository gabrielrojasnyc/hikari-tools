## [07:31] Strategic Pressure Test — Trading Stance Analysis
**What:** User challenged conservative posture; provided deep strategic analysis
**Trigger:** "Deepthink this too conservative what we need to do"

**Key Analysis:**
- VIX 21.10 is NOT elevated — it's normalization (avg ~19-20)
- Recency bias: 21 feels high because we've been at 15-16
- 25% size reduction = 25% alpha left on table if signals hit
- 27 crypto cycles with 0 signals = dead money, not risk management

**Revised Stance (Less Conservative):**
- Position size: 100% (remove 25% reduction)
- Confidence cutoff: 0.65 (was 0.75) — adds MSFT, TSLA
- Max trades: 5 (was 3) — full deployment
- Mean reversion: ADD (was skip) — VIX 21 is "pay attention" not "defensive"

**Today's Adjusted Book:**
1. GLD — 0.75 conf | Full size | Risk-off
2. AAPL — 0.72 conf | Full size | Support bounce
3. NVDA — 0.68 conf | Full size | AI narrative
4. MSFT — 0.65 conf | 75% size | Oversold
5. TSLA — 0.63 conf | 50% size | Momentum

**Key Insight:** Risk isn't losing money — it's missing moves in normalized vol.

**Open:** Awaiting user decision on defensive vs full deployment stance.
