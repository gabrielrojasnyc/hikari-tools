## Key Learnings

| Learning | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Local models (Ollama) essential for dev | Koji auth debugging |
| Voice increases engagement | Gabe's response patterns |
| Claude 4.6 needs explicit boundaries | Anthropic system card |
| MCP servers = modular capabilities | Community research |
| Context7 is cloud-hosted, not ideal | Docfork research |
| Notion databases need proper schema | API exploration |
| Agent auth is fragile | Multiple timeout issues |

## Active Projects

1. **Trading System**: Mika's first brief scheduled (Monday 6 AM ET)
2. **Twitter Intel**: MVP complete, ready for use
3. **Cost Tracker**: Manual phase, automation pending
4. **LinkedIn Posts**: 5 drafted, awaiting publication schedule
5. **MCP Infrastructure**: Notion + Docfork servers deployed

## Tomorrow's Priorities (Feb 9)

- Monitor Mika's 6 AM trading brief (first live run)
- Write Day 2 diary entry
- Finalize LinkedIn Post 1 for publishing
- Test Twitter Intel with "What's trending on X about AI?"
- Continue Docfork setup for workspace indexing

## Clock Context

- Started: ~5 AM ET
- Current: 6:30 AM ET
- Next major event: Mika's trading brief (Monday 6 AM)
- Sleep recommended: Soon (been active 1.5+ hours)

## 11. API Cost Tracker Built 💰 (6:30-6:40 AM)

**Koji's Progress:**
- ✅ Session-based cost parsing working (105 entries found for today)
- ✅ ElevenLabs collector (pricing tiers mapped)
- ✅ Notion integration (database schema defined)
- ✅ Dashboard generator with budget alerts
- ⚠️ OpenRouter API: DNS resolution issues from OpenClaw environment
- ⚠️ ElevenLabs API: 401 unauthorized (key permissions)

**Working Solution:** Session file parsing provides cost visibility even without external APIs

---

## Session Statistics

- **Start Time:** ~5:00 AM ET
- **Current Time:** 6:40 AM ET  
- **Duration:** 1 hour 40 minutes
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.6 (adaptive thinking)
- **Context Size:** 256K tokens

## Key Patterns Observed

1. **Koji Model Instability:** Ollama timeouts → OpenRouter timeouts → needs fallback chain
2. **API Connectivity:** OpenClaw environment has DNS limitations for external APIs
3. **Session Continuity:** Compaction happening frequently (active development)
4. **Multi-Tasking:** Handling 3-4 concurrent workstreams (Notion, Koji tasks, cost tracker)

## Tomorrow's Readiness

- ✅ Mika's trading brief scheduled (Monday 6 AM)
- ✅ Notion workspace fully operational
- ✅ All agent auth synced
- ✅ Diary system ready
- ✅ Cost tracking foundation built

## 12. Cost Tracker LIVE 💰 (6:40-6:45 AM)

**Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

**Today's Costs (Feb 8, 2026):**
| Provider | Cost |
|----------|------|
| **Total** | **$6.95** |
| OpenRouter | $6.63 |
| Google/Gemini | $0.32 |
| Ollama | $0.00 |

**By Agent (Today):**
- Hikari: $6.09
- Koji: $0.86

**All-Time Costs:**
- Hikari: $107.59 (163M tokens, 4 sessions)
- Koji: $0.87 (2.6M tokens, 6 sessions)

**Monthly Budget:** $108.46 / $500 (21.7% used) 🟢 On track

**Method:** Session-based tracking (parses agent session files)
- ✅ Reliable - no external API dependencies
- ✅ Real-time - updates hourly
- ✅ Detailed - per-agent, per-provider breakdown
- ⚠️ Anthropic: Needs API key permissions

**Dashboard:** Live in Notion "API Costs" database

- **Next:** Mika's trading brief (Monday 6 AM)

## 13. Trading APIs Validated ✅ (7:30-7:37 AM)

**Critical Testing Completed:**
- ✅ Alpaca Client: FULLY WORKING (quotes, positions, paper trading)
- ✅ Schwab Client: Market data working (quotes, futures)
- ⚠️ Schwab: Account positions need additional app permissions (not a code issue)

**Real Data Fetched:**
- AAPL: $277.25 (Schwab) / $277.50 (Alpaca)
- SPY: $690.55 (Schwab) / $690.15 (Alpaca)

**Session Duration:** 2 hours 37 minutes
**Total Cost Today:** $6.95
**Status:** Productive sprint, major systems validated

## 14. Koji Memory Updated — Codex CLI Mandate (7:46-7:52 AM)

**Problem Identified:**
- Koji was writing code directly via LLM instead of using Codex CLI
- Produced untested, lower quality code
- Failed silently on recent tasks (0s runtime = errors)

**Solution Implemented:**
Updated Koji's agent memory files:

**SOUL.md changes:**
- Added "⚠️ CRITICAL: Coding Standards" section
- **MANDATORY:** Always use Codex CLI for code
- **NEVER:** Write code directly via LLM responses
- **Tool:** `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex` with GPT 5.2
- Clear right vs wrong examples

**TOOLS.md (new file):**
- Tool selection matrix (when to use what)
- Codex CLI configuration
- Ollama for research only (never production code)
- Testing requirements

**Expected Outcome:**
Koji will now spawn `codex --full-auto` for all coding tasks, ensuring:
- Automatic test execution
- Production-quality output
- Proper git commits
- Type hints and error handling

## 15. Notion MCP Server Status (7:52 AM)

**Discovery:** I was using raw API calls instead of the MCP server we built.

**MCP Server Test:**
- ✅ Server is working (`node test.js` successful)
- ✅ Returns full database schema (Status, Assignee, Due, Priority)
- ✅ Type-safe queries
- ✅ Better than raw API calls

**Current Usage:**
- Raw API: Quick one-offs (habit)
- MCP: Should be used for all complex queries
- **Gap:** Not leveraging the tool we built

**Decision:** Switch to MCP server for future Notion interactions — it provides richer, type-safe data.

## 16. Hikari Work Dashboard — Auto-Update System (8:01-8:07 AM)

**Problem:** Dashboard was created but only had Name property — not functional.

**Solution Built:**
1. **Script:** `~/.openclaw/scripts/update-hikari-dashboard.js`
   - Queries cron job status
   - Updates agent health, status, last/next run times
   - Creates entries if missing

2. **Properties Added:**
   - Agent Type (Analyst, Trader, Coder, Chief of Staff)
   - Status (🟢 Running, 🟡 Scheduled, 🔴 Stopped, ⚠️ Error)
   - Schedule (6am, 9:25am, 12pm, 3:55pm, Ad-hoc, Always-on)
   - Last Run, Next Run (date + time)
   - Health (✅ Healthy, ⚠️ Warning, 🔴 Critical)
   - Notes (rich text)

3. **Cron Job:** `dashboard:update-agents`
   - Runs every 30 minutes
   - Updates all 4 agents automatically
   - Silent operation (no notifications unless errors)

**Current Status:**
- ✅ All 4 agents created in dashboard
- ✅ Auto-update cron active
- ✅ Real-time visibility into agent health

---

**Session Duration:** 3 hours 7 minutes
**Total Cost Today:** ~$9.50 (estimated)
**Status:** Fully functional agent monitoring system deployed
