# 2026-02-07 - Deep Research on Gabe

## LinkedIn Insights
- **Professional Tagline:** "Problem Finder | Product & AI Innovator | Leading the Charge in AI-Based Product Strategies"
- **15+ years** in technology leadership — not a newcomer, seasoned veteran
- Active in sharing thought leadership on generative AI, LLM evaluations, product management
- Posts about AWS re:Invent, scaling GenAI/ML systems

## GitHub Projects
- **hr-mcp-server** (JavaScript):
  - MCP = Model Context Protocol (Anthropic's new standard for AI tool integration)
  - This suggests Gabe is building HR-specific AI tools using cutting-edge protocols
  - 1 star, 4 forks — early stage but getting traction
- **performance comparison** (Python) — likely benchmarking tools

## Community Involvement
- **Volunteer Director** for Women In Technology (WIT) Single Mother Program Mentorship
- Active in **ADP iClub** events
- This shows leadership beyond just technical — he's invested in developing others

## Patent Update
- Application 19/173,377 is also published as **20250315791**
- Likely related to the "unified semantic and retrieval framework" for Lyric HCM
- This is defensible IP in the AI/semantic search space

## Key Observations
1. **The HR MCP Server** is interesting — Anthropic just released MCP in late 2024, and Gabe's already building HR-specific implementations. This could be the startup angle.
2. He's not just talking about AI — he's building it (JavaScript, Python projects)
3. The combination of enterprise experience (ADP) + hands-on building + community leadership = rare profile
4. Patent + open source projects = both protecting IP and contributing to community

## Gaps to Fill
- What exactly does the hr-mcp-server do?
- What's in the performance comparison repo?
- The patent details (still blocked by paywalls)
- His vision for the startup — is it related to MCP/HR integration?
