## 🤖 AI Intelligence

### Top 3 AI Trends
1. **Agentic AI Reality Check:** Mercor research shows AI agents still failing at real-world consulting tasks, but improving rapidly. "Vibe working" era beginning per Anthropic.
2. **Big Tech Model War:** OpenAI GPT-5.3 Codex launched minutes after Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 drop — both focused on coding/finance capabilities. OpenAI claims 25% speed improvement.
3. **Enterprise AI Security:** Goldman Sachs deploying AI agents for compliance; enterprises rushing to deploy autonomous systems while security lags.

### Additional Intel
- Amazon's Rufus evolved into "buy-for-me" agent with price tracking and autonomous purchasing
- Anthropic's Super Bowl ad skewering OpenAI went viral (production error spotted in OpenAI's ad)
- Meta starts big week in court with trials in New Mexico, LA

---

## 💡 Startup Ideas Spotted

1. **AI Agent Security Layer:** Enterprises deploying AI agents but security/governance lagging — opportunity for identity, visibility, and control tools specifically for autonomous AI systems
2. **Consulting AI Assistants:** Gap between AI agent capabilities and real consulting tasks presents vertical SaaS opportunity for human-in-the-loop AI consulting tools

---

## 🐦 Tweet Ideas for @gabrielrojasnyc

1. "AI agents failed consulting tasks but Mercor CEO says replacement is coming. The real opportunity? Tools that bridge the gap between AI capabilities and real-world complexity."

2. "OpenAI and Anthropic dropped competing coding models within minutes. This isn't innovation — it's a war of attrition. Who's actually building what developers need?"
