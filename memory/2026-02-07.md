# 2026-02-07 - Evening Summary

## Notion Workspace Fully Operational
Created 🎯 Gabe's Command Center with complete structure:
- 🧬 Master Tasks — All tasks tracked with status, assignee, domain
- 📡 Daily Capture Log — Automatic daily summaries
- ⚡ Hikari Work Dashboard — Agent swarm status (Mika, Sora, Koji)
- 📝 Content Pipeline — 5 LinkedIn posts with LinkedIn + Twitter versions

All content migrated from files to Notion for collaborative review.

## Trading Agent Architecture Locked
Final 4x/day schedule (ET):
- 6:00 AM — Mika (Analyst): Pre-market brief
- 9:25 AM — Sora (Trader): Pre-open check
- 12:00 PM — Sora (Trader): Midday position check
- 3:55 PM — Sora (Trader): EOD report, close day trades

Budget: $500, paper-first validation. First run: Monday 6 AM.

## Gemini Memory Search Fixed
Switched from Gemini API (403 errors) to local Ollama (embeddinggemma-300M).
- Zero API costs
- No batch job failures
- Working via node-llama-cpp

## Telegram Formatting Standards (Global)
Documented best practices for all agents:
- No markdown tables (don't render)
- Use bullet lists with emojis instead
- Code blocks for aligned data
- Data cards for visual hierarchy
- Mobile-first: < 40 chars per line

Reference: `docs/telegram-formatting-guide.md`

## Identity & Creative Mandate Updated
Reinforced in MEMORY.md and SOUL.md:
- First principles leadership (Elon/Jensen style) — core philosophy
- Creative mandate: "Creativity is a weapon, not decoration"
- Hikari: Illuminate, design, create artifacts
- Make it beautiful: Aesthetic choices reveal philosophical ones

## Integration Research
### ElevenLabs
- OpenClaw has native TTS support
- Can voice Mika's briefings, trading alerts
- Needs API key setup

### Twitter
- No built-in skill, but browser automation works
- Community "chirp" skill available for CLI posting
- API route requires dev account

### Claude Cowork
- Desktop automation for non-coders
- Good for file organization, report synthesis
- Complementary to OpenClaw (not replacement)

## Key Decisions
- First principles framing is independent leadership philosophy (not ADP-specific)
- 62.5% mindset: Fundamental rethinking, not incremental optimization
- Notion as single source of truth for tasks + content
- Hourly trading rejected in favor of 4x/day strategic timing
