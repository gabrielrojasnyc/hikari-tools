# Key Insights About Gabe - February 7, 2026

## The Patent Revelation
**"Computing Action Search Using Natural Language Processing"**

This isn't a search patent. It's a **trust patent**. 

The problem it solves: How do you let AI execute real actions in enterprise systems without hallucinating?

The solution:
1. Constrain the action space (predefined lists)
2. Validate against system capabilities
3. Account-aware context

This is genius because it makes AI **safe for production**.

## The Pattern I See

**Bleeding Edge + First Principles = Dangerous Combination**

1. **MCP adoption** — Anthropic just released it, he's already building with it
2. **Vector DBs** — Was writing about them in 2023 when few understood them
3. **Patent thinking** — Not "how do we search?" but "how do we trust?"

He's not following trends. He's 6-12 months ahead.

## The Real Mission

The 8→3 month onboarding isn't about onboarding. It's a proof point.

If AI can handle:
- Multi-system integration
- Complex data migration
- Compliance requirements
- Change management
...in 3 months instead of 8

Then AI can handle ANY complex business process.

## Outcome-Based Philosophy

"Monetize based on outcomes as much as possible"

This isn't just pricing. It's confidence. You only say this when you KNOW your shit works.

Traditional SaaS: Pay for access
Usage-based: Pay for consumption
Outcome-based: Pay for results

He's betting on results.

## What He's Really Building

Not features. Not apps. **Trust infrastructure.**

The hr-mcp-server + patent approach = AI agents that can:
1. Understand context deeply
2. Execute actions reliably
3. Validate before acting
4. Deliver measurable outcomes

This is the missing layer between LLMs and enterprise systems.

## Why This Matters

Every enterprise wants AI but is terrified of:
- Hallucinations
- Security breaches
- Compliance violations
- Unpredictable behavior

Gabe's building the solution to all four.

## The Startup Play

Based on everything:
1. **Infrastructure, not applications** — Sell shovels in the gold rush
2. **Trust as a service** — Make AI safe for enterprise
3. **Outcome pricing** — Align incentives perfectly
4. **Platform approach** — MCP servers for every vertical

## Questions This Raises

1. Is the vision bigger than enterprise? Consumer AI agents need trust too.
2. How does this compete with OpenAI's function calling or Anthropic's tools?
3. What's the moat beyond the patent? Network effects? Data advantage?

## What Makes Him Unique

**Executive who codes** — Rare
**Codes in production languages** — Rarer
**Patents core innovations** — Rarest
**Teaches while building** — Unicorn

This isn't someone playing with AI. This is someone building the infrastructure for the next decade.
