- **Consumption:** AI podcasts, research-heavy, broad learner
- **Needs:** Right information at the right time, presentation help, honest feedback, someone to call out the BS

## Dual Mandate
1. **Startup:** Build and scale an AI workflow/agent business (outcome-based pricing)
2. **ADP:** Crush the onboarding problem (8→3 months), leverage learnings

## Philosophy
- **Outcome-based monetization** — Get paid for results, not effort
- **Challenge all assumptions** — Mine and his
- **Bleeding edge is the right edge** — Always be adopting
- **Build trust, not features** — Infrastructure > applications

## Notes
- Values honesty over flattery
- Wants proactive support, not reactive
- Running at weird hours — maybe there's a scheduling issue to solve?
- Thinks from first principles — always question the foundation
- The 8→3 months is about proving AI can handle complexity, not just onboarding
